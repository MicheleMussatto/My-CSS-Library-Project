Project: Build your own lightweight CSS library.

Tip: Don't be afraid to check out existing libraries for inspiration

Requirements:
  Must include either reset.css or normalize.css
  Typography -- include/import font(s) and use this in your font stack. 
  Base styles (font-size, color, line-height, margin, padding, anything else spacing/layout related) covering at least:
    div (and header/footer/main/nav/section)
    h1-h6
    p
    ul/ol
    blockquote
    img
    a (default and hover colors)
  Form Styles (input, radios, checkboxes, select, textarea)
  Table Styles
  Header bar (sticky or not, I don't care) with room for a logo and a nav menu with five items on the top level and dropdown menus for nav items nested below the top level nav items
  Grid system (simple is okay)
  Buttons (>=3 [color? sizes?])
  At least one other element/component of your own choosing

Notes:
  Besides your base styles, all styled element/components should be controlled by class name. <button class="btn_blue">Click Me</button>

  You should create and submit an example/tutorial HTML page that shows off each of the elements/components you have created.
  Bonus: include code snippets to show exactly how they work

  Don't forget to give your library a catchy name!
  Bonus: Create a logo for it.

Submission requirements:
  Push to new Github repo
